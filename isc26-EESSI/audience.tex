%This tutorial is intended for
\begin{itemize}
    \item Researchers looking to empower themselves with a software stack that is consistent across architectures without compromising on
          performance; %on top of what is provided centrally by the HPC support team;
    \item Developers who build and test their software across different HPC systems and the cloud;
    \item System administrators and user support teams, responsible for the operational aspects of HPC systems and concerned about
          hardware optimised scientific software installations;
%     \item user support teams who need to provide a consistent central software stack for end users, and want to do so in
%           a reproducible way;
    %\item Cloud and CI users, who want to use a common stack of optimised scientific software installations;
    \item System manufacturers and integrators interested in state-of-the-art software installation approaches, who want to
          leverage the collective expertise incorporated in EasyBuild and EESSI.
\end{itemize}

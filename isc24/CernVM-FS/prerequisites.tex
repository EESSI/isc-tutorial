No prior knowledge of CernVM-FS is required.
Only fairly basic experience with using HPC infrastructure is assumed, including:

\begin{itemize}
\item Basic knowledge of Linux shell environment (SSH, filesystem navigation, \ldots)
\item Basic knowledge of networking (IP address, port, client/server, network latency, \ldots)
%\item Basic knowledge of Linux file systems (files, directories, navigation, \ldots)
\end{itemize}

\noindent Hands-on experience with running scientific software workloads is a plus, but not strictly necessary.

\noindent Attendees are expected to bring their laptop which should be able to connect to the WiFi and use SSH to connect to a remote virtual machine running Linux.

%Attendees wishing to participate in the guided examples are expected to use their
%own notebook computers with a working SSH client.

CernVM-FS, the CernVM File System (also known as CVMFS), is a file distribution service that is particularly well suited to distribute software installations across a large number of systems world-wide in an efficient way.

From an end user perspective, files in a CernVM-FS repository are available read-only via a subdirectory in /cvmfs, with a user experience similar to that of an on-demand streaming service for music or video, but then (mainly) applied to software installations.

Based on attendance at previous EESSI and EasyBuild events, including:
\begin{itemize}
\item recent webinar series related to EESSI in May-June 2025 with over 150 registrations;
\item the yearly EasyBuild User Meetings (over 50 in-person attendees, alongside over 70 online registrations, in 2025);
\item an online EESSI tutorial in Dec'23 with over 130 registrations;
\item the in-person (half-day) ISC'22 EasyBuild tutorial with about 20 attendees;
\end{itemize}
we anticipate this EESSI tutorial to be well attended with 20-50 attendees.

%HV: Do we have the attendance of the workshop series we did? 

%KH I would've gone with 50/25/25, but this works too (maybe better even)
% MG: This was just a blind guess ;)
%KH seems about right I think, we want to keep it beginner-oriented, 25% advanced may be too much... maybe 50/30/20 is less awkward?
% I love how 'awkward' is such an awkward word to type... :D (no, haven't had beer yet)

% KH: Markus, I'm signing off for tonight... I'll be around tomorrow, definitely in the morning (have a student intern to keep busy in the afternoon, but I'll be around on Slack)
%MG: Yea, I will also stop working soon

% KH: do we need anything from Maxime? It's probably good to tell him that now, since he'll only be around after 1-2pm tomorrow.
%MG: For the submission, we'll need a short bio (some text) For Alan and the two of us, I will copy from last year unless I receive an update.
% KH I already asked him for a bio. And a picture. I'll mail that too. => DONE

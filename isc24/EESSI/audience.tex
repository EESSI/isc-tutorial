This tutorial is intended for
\begin{itemize}
    \item system managers and administrators, responsible for the operational aspects of HPC systems and concerned about hardware optimised scientific software installations;
    \item user support teams who need to provide a consistent central software stack for end users, and want to do so in a reproducible way;
    \item end users who want to empower themselves to use a software stack they require without compromising on performance, on top of what is provided centrally by the HPC support team;
    \item cloud and CI users, that want to use a common stack of optimized scientific software installations;
    \item system manufacturers and integrators interested in state-of-the-art software installation tools, who want to leverage the collective expertise incorporated in EasyBuild.

%\comment{Kenneth: check head count EUM'23}

%Based on attendance at previous EESSI and EasyBuild events, including the yearly EasyBuild User Meetings (over 30 attendees in the last physical edition in 2023, close to 100 in 2021 and 2022 in an online setting) and previous tutorials (PRACE-VI-SEEM 2017 Spring School with 25-30 attendees, a free online EasyBuild tutorial in June'20 with about 100 attendees, the half-day ISC'21 tutorial with over 25 attendees, and the in-person (half-day) ISC'22 tutorial with about 20 attendees, we anticipate this EESSI tutorial to be well attended (20-50 attendees).

%KH I would've gone with 50/25/25, but this works too (maybe better even)
% MG: This was just a blind guess ;)
%KH seems about right I think, we want to keep it beginner-oriented, 25% advanced may be too much... maybe 50/30/20 is less awkward?
% I love how 'awkward' is such an awkward word to type... :D (no, haven't had beer yet)

% KH: Markus, I'm signing off for tonight... I'll be around tomorrow, definitely in the morning (have a student intern to keep busy in the afternoon, but I'll be around on Slack)
%MG: Yea, I will also stop working soon

% KH: do we need anything from Maxime? It's probably good to tell him that now, since he'll only be around after 1-2pm tomorrow.
%MG: For the submission, we'll need a short bio (some text) For Alan and the two of us, I will copy from last year unless I receive an update.
% KH I already asked him for a bio. And a picture. I'll mail that too. => DONE

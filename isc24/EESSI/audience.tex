This tutorial is intended for
\begin{itemize}
    \item system managers and administrators, responsible for the operational aspects of HPC systems and concerned about hardware optimised scientific software installations;
    \item user support teams who need to provide a consistent central software stack for end users, and want to do so in a reproducible way;
    \item end users who want to empower themselves to manage the software stack they require without compromising on performance, on top of what is provided centrally by the HPC support team;
    \item system manufacturers and integrators interested in state-of-the-art software installation tools, who want to leverage the collective expertise incorporated in EasyBuild.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Previous tutorials}

A free online introductory tutorial on CernVM-FS was organised as a part of the 6th EasyBuild User Meeting
(Jan'21)\footnote{\href{https://easybuild.io/eum21/\#cvmfs-tutorial}{https://easybuild.io/eum21/\#cvmfs-tutorial}}.
It consisted of 5 short sessions (1h each), one per day in the same week, and was attended by about 25 people.
A quick anonymous evaluation survey afterwards showed that 75\% of attendees rated the tutorial as ``excellent'',
while the remaining 25\% rated it as ``good''.

More recently (Dec'23), a 3-hour free online tutorial ``\emph{Best Practices for CernVM-FS in HPC}''
was organised in the context of the MultiXscale EuroHPC Centre-of-Excellence
\footnote{\href{https://multixscale.github.io/cvmfs-tutorial-hpc-best-practices}{https://multixscale.github.io/cvmfs-tutorial-hpc-best-practices}}.
It was a resounding success, with over 200 registrations, and 125 actual attendees during the online session.
An anonymous survey that was completed by over 50 attendees showed that the tutorial was very well received:
it got an average rating of 8.64 out of 10, with 88\% giving a score of 8 or higher, and over 90\% of survey
participants stating that they would ``definitely'' recommend the tutorial to friends or colleagues (along with 8\%
answering ``maybe'', and one person stating ``I'm not sure'').

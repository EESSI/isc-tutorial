This tutorial is intended for a wide range of profiles, including:

\begin{itemize}
    \item HPC system administrators and user support teams who want to provide a rich central software stack without
          having to manage it in isolation;
    \item Developers of scientific software who want to leverage a common software stack, for example for
          Continuous Integration (CI) purposes or other testing efforts;
    \item Scientific researchers who like to use uniform software stack on all systems they have access to,
          including their own personal workstations or laptops, HPC infrastructure, and cloud environments.
    %\item system managers and administrators, responsible for the operational aspects of HPC systems and concerned about hardware optimised scientific software installations;
    %\item user support teams who need to provide a consistent central software stack for end users, and want to do so in a reproducible way;
    %\item end users who want to empower themselves to use a software stack they require without compromising on performance, on top of what is provided centrally by the HPC support team;
    %\item cloud and CI users, that want to use a common stack of optimised scientific software installations;
    %\item system manufacturers and integrators interested in state-of-the-art software installation tools, who want to leverage the collective expertise incorporated in EasyBuild.
\end{itemize}
